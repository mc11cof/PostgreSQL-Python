# Automate-PostgreSQL-with-Py
Application which allows you to make PostgreSQL databases with Python

I used the psycopg2 library which is used to oparetes different database tasks on PostgreSQL using the python coding language.

On the "connect_to_dataase.py" file, I simply show how to connect to a PostgreSQL database with python. 

On the "main.py" file, I use a list of data from a .txt file which is then commited to my PostgreSQL database.
